# Welcome to DEMO_CDK!

I'm experimenting with AWS CDK for Golang. 

**NOTICE**: Go support is still in Developer Preview.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `go test`         run unit tests

 Slides are avalible in the **./presentation** folder.
